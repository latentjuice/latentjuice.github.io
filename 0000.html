    is it even true that value and exclusivity are entangled? 
    what was it that made me think about this? 
    it was a while back (lol i need to update these pages right when i have an idea) -- 
    but my mom and i were talking about expensive purses, and how some of them have price tags that are genuinely ridiculous, like $400k?
    tbf, i'm not trying to say "oh wow, look how crazy these rich people are". i don't think it's fair to look down on a POV that i do not understand.
    clearly people are buying them, which means that >1 individuals perceive the value of this purse to outweight the value of $400k cash. even stronger assumption -- this purse is the most valuable allocation of this $400k (opportunity cost), 
    by whatever definition of valuable this particular individual believes.
    i'd venture to very little of this value is derived from the raw material, labor, etc. and that most of this value resides in the fact that most other people cannot own this purse. there's smth that functions as a gatekeeper -- in this case, wealth.
    i'm sure you can think of plenty of other examples where wealth is the gatekeeper. are there other kinds of gatekeepers?

    i was also thinking about airport lounges, and how that seemed so exclusive as a kid. it was for the big boys and girls, the C-suite of the world, not for the riffraff. but hey, i got a capital one venture x card and now i have access to some nice lounges! i was so excited, but now there's so much of a waitlist to actually get in the lounges (bc of countless other ppl like me LOL). so my perception of the value of this lounge is somewhat diminished, but why? bc i have to wait on a waitlist? bc the act of waiting on a list takes away from the "special treatment" of being catered to in a lounge, since it puts me on equal footing with everyone else with a venture x card?

    maybe the real value lies in whatever must truly be exclusive for myself -- as in, it's not possible for anyone else to get value out of this. like, a great conversation with a best friend. anyone else can be swapped into that position, but they wouldn't be able to really get the same value out of it bc it's purely a function of our relation. maybe it has something to do with being "non-fungible"; i.e. you can't swap me out for someone else and expect everything to be the same (but you very well could, in an impersonal lounge).

    tbh, i'm not quite sure what i'm talking about rn, maybe ill come back to this post and make some more sense of it. as a particular case study, im kinda curious how lobsters went from a meal for prisoners + the impoverished to something reserved for higher classes. the value changed not bc of anything intrinsic, but some surrounding context

        from <a href=https://x.com/she_llac/status/1862577202916679898>@she_llac</a>: 
        interesting framing seeing that it's... almost all things? 
        it's harder to name things that are only valuable because they're exclusive. 
        still, I think the vast majority of things are primarily valuable in and of itself? 
        the only pure counterexample I can think of would be something like sport competitions, where the value of a medal is its exclusivity
