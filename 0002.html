        what do i mean by high frequencies and low frequencies when talking about smth as complicated as personality? 
        the way i think abt it is like, you're doing a fourier transform on the signal someone is communicating with you. 
        this signal can be communicated in many ways (often at the same time). when i say frequency here it's completely disambiguated from high-pitch vs low-pitch.
    </p>

        grunting is very low frequency. i can communicate very limited kinds of information. i can say "uh-UH-uh?" for "i dunno ðŸ¤·", but also "uh-UH-uhH?" for "what's the time?". maybe what i'm trying to say is that lower frequencies require a LOT more context to understand. (actually, im curious if any of yall were able to understand the intonation there haha)
    </p>
    <p>    
        in comparison, written text is fairly high bandwidth, since i can communicate at a pretty high resolution without the need for too much context. 
        good writers have plenty of frequencies to play with to craft a message. 
        but even still, context is required here -- you must be able to read english. english from the 2020s. informal english ("what does 'smth' mean?"). not just grammatical context, but also just relevant background -- what do i mean by a fourier transform?
    </p>
    <p>
        images, still, have an even higher bandwidth -- "a picture is worth a thousand words" -- and so has even higher frequencies at its disposal.
        a movie director has much more subtle variables to play with to communicate a message. you can mess with not just dialogue, but also lighting, camera angle, etc that you don't have access to with writing. obviously there are different methods to achieve similar intentions with writing, but i think my point is that you can do so much quicker with visual media.

        low frequencies require more time to observe (time-frequency tradeoff)
    </p>
    <p>
        maybe higher frequency messages take less effort to grasp?
    </p>
    <p>
        maybe its the case that all mediums of communication have versions that are lower-frequency and higher-frequency -- i.e. sonically can range from grunting to like, a concerto
    </p>
    <p>
        whatever the case, i think there's a lot of low-frequency information inherent in communication that we can gloss over. this sort of low-frequency information requires much more time (context) to truly understand someone's intended message. dang i wish i could pull out an example lol
