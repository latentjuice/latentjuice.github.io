<h2>Hi</h2>
<p>Welcome to my whiteboard!</p>
<img src="img/charlie-crazy-map.png" alt="I'm going crazy" style="width:300px;height:150px;">
<br>
<p>Why am I doing this?</p>
<ol>
    <li>This satisfies a medium-length niche between tweets and longer essays (that I plan to host on Substack). I've tried consolidating some of my ideas into longer essays but find that I keep talking myself in circles, referencing other ideas that each deserve their own essays, and end up getting nowhere XD. This is my attempt to map out a "web" of my worldview!</li>
    <br>
    <li>I have too much inertia in publishing stuff I write. By outright claiming this as my whiteboard, I feel less of a need to make things "perfect", whatever that means.</li>
    <br>
    <li>I wanna do some cool stuff on here! I'm not particularly experiences with HTML/CSS but this seems like a fun way to learn. Since this is built off a git repo, I could maybe add in some versioning so you can see the trajectory of any given snippet. Further down the road, I might add a visualizer of my whiteboard graph, and you could traverse all the nodes and edges. Eventually I could even add an LLM so you can type something in to find the most relevant snippet. Or imagine having several different versions of the same message tailored to different audiences! Point is: the world is my oyster!</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for taking a look :)</p>
